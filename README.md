## Robotics Simulation  Environments
This repo contains diversified variants of benchmark robot manipulation tasks that are challenging for existing methods.

### Fetch Robot
We modify the desired and initial goal distribution and add obstacles in original Fetch Tasks (FetchSlide, FetchPush, FetchPickAndPlace) to build more complex environments.

- FetThrowRubberBall
- FetchPushWallObstacle
- FetchPickAndPlace-InAir
- FetchPnPObstacle 

### Baxter Robot
  The same environments with Fetch robot.
